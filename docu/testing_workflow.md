Testing Workflow
=================
The organisation [Alarmphone](https://alarmphone.org) supports us with the testing of the application.

We created a [project page](https://github.com/sea-watch/SAR-Client/projects/1) to keep track of which issue has been fixed in which version.

Developer Info
--------------
For every planed released we create a new tab in which the card for a resolved issue will be droped so that the testers now what to test after every release. That means that the person who merges a feature branch which contains the fix for an issue has to add the card of that issue to the next release.

Tester Info
------------
Please label all tested issues with "tested"
